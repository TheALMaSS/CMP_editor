Creating a new farm operation requires some knowledge of the existing ALMaSS codebase, and also of C++ coding. If you find any issue, please contact: elena.fini@agro.au.dk.
For the purpose of flowchart design, if cannot complete step 2 (which requires programming knowledge), you may still perform step 1 locally - just keep in mind that, in order for your farm operation to be correctly simulated, someone else will have to complete step 2, eventually.

1) Open the file operations.json and add your new farm operation following the format of the other entries. You will have to specify a C++ function name for it, which will have to match the function you generate in step 2.
2) Open the ALMaSS project in a code editor and find the file FarmFuncs.cpp (+ its associated header FarmFuncs.h). You may use an existing function with a behaviour similar to what you want to obtain, copy-paste it, rename it, and modify its behaviour to match exactly what you want to achieve.
